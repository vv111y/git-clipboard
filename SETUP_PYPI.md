# PyPI Publishing Setup

This repository is configured to automatically publish to PyPI when a GitHub Release is created. To enable this functionality, you need to configure a PyPI API token as a GitHub repository secret.

## Prerequisites

1. A PyPI account with permissions to publish the `git-clipboard` package
2. Maintainer or admin access to this GitHub repository

## Step 1: Create a PyPI API Token

1. Go to [PyPI Account Settings](https://pypi.org/manage/account/)
2. Scroll down to the "API tokens" section
3. Click "Add API token"
4. Choose one of these scopes:
   - **Recommended**: "Scope to project" and select `git-clipboard` (if the project already exists)
   - **Alternative**: "Entire account" (less secure, but works for initial publishing)
5. Give the token a descriptive name like `git-clipboard-github-actions`
6. Click "Add token"
7. **Important**: Copy the token immediately - you won't be able to see it again!

The token will look like: `pypi-AgEIcHlwaS5vcmcCJGxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxx`

## Step 2: Add the Token to GitHub Secrets

1. Go to your GitHub repository: `https://github.com/vv111y/git-clipboard`
2. Click on "Settings" (in the repository menu, not your personal settings)
3. In the left sidebar, click on "Secrets and variables" â†’ "Actions"
4. Click "New repository secret"
5. Set the secret details:
   - **Name**: `PYPI_API_TOKEN`
   - **Secret**: Paste the PyPI token you copied in Step 1
6. Click "Add secret"

## Step 3: Verify the Setup

The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`) is already configured to use this secret. It will automatically:

1. Trigger when you create a GitHub Release
2. Build the Python package
3. Publish to PyPI using the token

To test the setup:

1. Create a new tag and GitHub Release following the instructions in `CONTRIBUTING.md`
2. The publish workflow should run automatically
3. Check the Actions tab to see if the workflow completes successfully
4. Verify the package appears on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/git-clipboard/

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Error: "Invalid or non-existent authentication information"**
- The token may be incorrect or expired
- Regenerate the token on PyPI and update the GitHub secret

**Error: "The user 'USERNAME' isn't allowed to upload to project 'git-clipboard'"**
- Your PyPI account doesn't have permission to publish this package
- Contact the package owner to add you as a maintainer

**Error: "File already exists"**
- You're trying to upload a version that already exists on PyPI
- Bump the version number in `pyproject.toml` and `src/git_clipboard/__init__.py`

### Security Notes

- Never commit PyPI tokens to the repository
- Use project-scoped tokens when possible
- Rotate tokens periodically
- Only trusted maintainers should have access to publishing tokens
